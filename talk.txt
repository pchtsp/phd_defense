Hello,

I'm going to discuss the results of my PhD thesis that is titled: "". This will be the structure of the talk. An introduction and some context, my contributions, and some conclusions.

Given the title, one would think that this thesis has a very narrow subject. It does not. As we will see later, the planning of maintenances for aircraft is not so different from other, more earthly decision problems. Efficiently maintaining systems is a challenge. As we produce a greater number of more complex things that need to be maintained for longer, this challenge grows. As an example, we're now planning to build in France nuclear waste storage facilities that are supposed to work for 100 years. (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cig%C3%A9o#Description_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale)
This is longer than most countries in the world have existed (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rfIzSh5fZ-lwqOlGCPWuKYZA-hAAg01K9VzIOSbolpA/edit#gid=0). Another example: most renewable projects involve building infrastructure (solar, wind, batteries) that is both complex and needs to last for a long time in order to make it economically and environmentally viable.

The Military Flight and Maintenance Planning problem consists on assigning missions to a fleet of military aircraft, while scheduling the necessary usage-based maintenances to keep the fleet in good operational status. This problem can be abstracted into three main concepts: resources, tasks and usage-based recovery tasks. These three concepts relate the problem to a series of alternative planning problems. Resources can be aircraft, machines, nuclear plants, trains or people. Tasks can be missions, actual tasks, energy production or shifts. Recovery tasks can be maintenances, setups, refueling or days off.

Each problem can then, of course have specific characteristics that differentiate it from the other. In our case, I will present the specifics of our problem. We have a set of schedules missions. Each mission lasts of several periods and demands...

Some additional vocabulary that may be useful for the rest of the talk. This is what a solution looks like: a calendar table with aircraft in rows and periods in columns. In each cell, imagine there can be a maintenance, a mission or nothing. Of course, it's the contents of the table that we need to fill with a valid solution. Another way of thinking of a solution is in terms of patterns and aircraft. We call a pattern to a possible row of the solution. In particular, each aircraft has its own set of possible patterns. A solution consists of assigning one pattern to each aircraft. 

Two additional ways of encoding a solution come from lineal programming: we have a binary variable that has value 1 if the aircraft is doing mission in a period and another binary variable that has value 1 if aircraft starts a maintenance in a period. The second


<!-- These two are two classic ways of encoding a planning solution. -->

<!-- We deal with the long term planning of maintenances and missions. -->

I will know present the three main contributions of this thesis.

The first contribution of this the thesis involves the study of the complexity of the problem, a first direct approach to solve it, and sensibility analysis. We prove the long term variant as NP-Complete in the following way. We take a problem called "" and we reduce out Flight and Maintenance Planning problem into a Flight Assignment problem that can be used to solve the "" problem.
This proves the complexity of the long term MFMP.

The first model is a classic NRP formulation where we assign missions to aircraft, we assign starts of maintenances. Constraints are mainly ways to tie both decisions, count and limit flight hours, and comply with maintenance capacity, mission requirements and fleet status requirements.

Experiments show that this model performs well in small and medium sized-instances. We tested several configurations and particular issues were encountered when changing the default flight hours and...

The second contribution of this thesis consists on a Machine Learning application to predict good solutions.

If we remember the pattern-like idea, imagine we only think of maintenance patterns. That is, we now choose what maintenance pattern to assign to an aircraft and it includes all the maintenances it will have. This change can be incorporated to our previous MIP model and it offers interesting insights. It generates a lot more variables than the previous one but also offers a better lineal relaxation.

If we have patterns, then we can make use of pattern predicting techniques, such as those in the ML world. 
The idea is the following, we take the input data of an instance, we apply several functions to aggregate that data. We then predict some characteristics of the optimal solution based on that input data. We use that predicted information to reduce the solution space.

In this case, we predicted an aggregate function on these patterns: the average distance between maintenances. 
We can, for example, predict the likelihood that one of these patterns ends up in our optimal solution. In our case, what we predicted was 


The techniques that have been conceived are generic approaches that have been adapted
