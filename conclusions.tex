  \begin{block}{\textbf{Conclusions}}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The long term MFMP problem is presented}, analyzed.
    \item \textbf{Several solving approaches are implemented}
      including MIP-based, metaheuristics, ML-based, and graph-based
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{\textbf{Perspectives}}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Benchmark} these approaches with similar MFMP and FMP problems.
      \item \textbf{Integrate} novel techniques (ML and graph) inside known frameworks (CG, GRASP).
    \end{itemize}
