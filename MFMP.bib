    abstract = {The primary objective in military aviation is to optimize operational readiness: the capability to perform assigned flight missions. In terms of a flight planning process, operational readiness has three primary components: availability, serviceability and sustainability. Furthermore, it is influenced by aircraft downtime due to preventive maintenance at prescribed flight time interval. In practice, aircraft flight scheduling (including maintenance constraints) tends to be managed manually and on a day-to-day basis, leading to a reactive approach to aircraft flight hour allocation in which problems with respect to availability, serviceability and sustainability can easily develop. Optimization models have been developed to address this issue, but none of them cover the full scope of operational readiness. This work introduces a flight and maintenance planning optimization model that simultaneously addresses the aspects of availability, serviceability and sustainability, leading to a pro-active, efficient and more robust scheduling effort. The proposed model is tested, verified and validated using Royal Netherlands Air Force data and infrastructure related to the CH47D Chinook helicopter fleet.},

    abstract = {Every aircraft, military or civilian, must be grounded for maintenance after it has completed a certain number of flight hours since its last maintenance check. In this paper, we address the problem of deciding which available aircraft should fly and for how long, and which grounded aircraft should perform maintenance operations, in a group of aircraft that comprise a combat unit. The objective is to achieve maximum availability of the unit over the planning horizon. We develop a multiobjective optimization model for this problem, and we illustrate its application and solution on a real life instance drawn from the Hellenic Air Force. We also propose two heuristic approaches for solving large scale instances of the problem. We conclude with a discussion that gives insight into the behavior of the model and of the heuristics, based on the analysis of the results obtained.},

abstract = {We develop a mixed integer linear program (MIP) to plan daily flying and maintenance for a small fleet (e.g., a squadron) of military aircraft for a planning horizon of up to 30 days. Our aircraft maintenance prescriptions include regular inspections (every few days for one day at a time) and phased maintenance (every few hundred flying hours, for extended periods of several days). Aircraft may be inducted into phased maintenance over a range of completed flying hours. Plans should ideally maintain an orderly or �staggered' distribution of flight hours on the squadron's aircraft to avoid aircraft queuing for maintenance. Other considerations include minimum and maximum daily flying hours for each flying aircraft, limited daily maintenance man-hours, ensuring a minimum number of daily spare aircraft (an aircraft is a spare if it is able to fly but is not assigned flight hours), and limiting the number of consecutive days that a serviceable aircraft does not fly. The MIP objective expresses penalties associated with not meeting requirements for flying rates (for the squadron, each aircraft and each day), phased maintenance inductions, and retaining an appropriate squadron flight hour stagger. We use 16 realistic test cases that vary squadron sizes, planning horizons, flying requirements and initial conditions to demonstrate the MIP's practical value for fleet planners. Overall, the MIP provides good solutions within a one-hour time limit, with almost half of the cases providing optimal solutions and five of those in less than one minute. For larger test cases without proven optimal solutions within one hour, we apply a heuristic that partitions the squadrons into subsets of equal size. This heuristic provides solutions to all remaining test cases within one hour with combined objective values equal to or close to the best known solution. Sample figures illustrate the flying and maintenance plan in a form suitable for use by fleet planners.},

We construct a mixed integer linear program that schedules the weeks during which each helicopter undergoes maintenance, as well as the weeks during which a helicopter conducts operations either at Clearwater Air Station, Florida or at one of two deployment sites. The schedules must consider different maintenance types, maintenance capacity and various operational requirements, e.g., the number of helicopters simultaneously patrolling a deployment site. Using data from the operations at Clearwater, we generate optimal schedules on a Unix workstation with modest computing power in less than 3min. Planners have been using our mixed integer linear program since January, 2005 for scheduling guidance.},

abstract = {Maintenance of the training aircraft causes downtime of operations and thereby reduces the operational availability, which is crucial for flight planning in a training organisation. Manual daily planning within the fleet delivers suboptimal results and often causes discontinued flight of several aircraft that have to be maintained at the same time. Optimal maintenance schedule of training aircraft can be obtained by a sliding scale method. This paper presents a mathematical model of the sliding scale formulated by a mixed integer linear problem. Allocation of flight hours is optimised by using AMPL programming language, assuring that a sufficient number of aircraft are always available for training. The model can be used by a flight dispatch department in a training organisation as a basis for optimised planning and reduction of maintenance downtime},

    abstract = { In an effort to control costs, airlines have begun to concentrate on their maintenance operations as a potential source for savings. Nevertheless, federal regulations and internal safety policies effectively limit cost savings to improvements in productivity and scheduling. The purpose of this paper is to present a model that can be used by planners to both locate maintenance stations and to develop flight schedules that better meet the cyclical demand for maintenance. The problem is formulated as a min-cost, multicommodity flow network with integral constraints, and solved using a two-phase heuristic. The procedure is demonstrated with data supplied by American Airlines for their Boeing 727 fleet. The results show a significant improvement over current techniques, and indicate that substantial cost reductions can be achieved by eliminating up to 5 of the 22 maintenance bases now in operation. Similar results were obtained for American's Super 80 and DC-10 fleets. Perturbation analysis confirms the robustness of these findings, and suggests that loss in flexibility due to interruptions in the flight schedule will be negligible. }

abstract="Given a flight schedule and set of aircraft, the fleet assignment problem is to determine which type of aircraft should fly each flight segment. This paper describes a basic daily, domestic fleet assignment problem and then presents chronologically the steps taken to solve it efficiently. Our model of the fleet assignment problem is a large multi-commodity flow problem with side constraints defined on a time-expanded network. These problems are often severely degenerate, which leads to poor performance of standard linear programming techniques. Also, the large number of integer variables can make finding optimal integer solutions difficult and time-consuming. The methods used to attack this problem include an interior-point algorithm, dual steepest edge simplex, cost perturbation, model aggregation, branching on set-partitioning constraints and prioritizing the order of branching. The computational results show that the algorithm finds solutions with a maximum optimality gap of 0.02{\%} and is more than two orders of magnitude faster than using default options of a standard LP-based branch-and-bound code.",

Though maintenance scheduling comes as an end stage in an airline operation, it has potential for cost savings. Maintenance scheduling is an easily understood but difficult to solve problem. Given a flight schedule with aircraft assigned to it, the aircraft maintenance-scheduling problem is to determine which aircraft should fly which segment and when and where each aircraft should undergo different levels of maintenance check required by the Federal Aviation Administration. The objective is to minimize the maintenance cost and any costs incurred during the re-assignment of aircraft to the flight segments. This paper provides a complete formulation for maintenance scheduling and a heuristic approach to solve the problem. The heuristic procedure provides good solutions in reasonable computation time. This model can be used by mid-sized airline corporations to optimize their maintenance costs."
